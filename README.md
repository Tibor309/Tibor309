## Hi, i'm tibor

I'm a computer scientist, im 21, and trying to learn programming *slowly*. Yes, i'm a furry, but im not a zoo or a weird one. I like messing with tech, and software. Most of the time i'm online so if you wanna have a chat go ahead, i don't bite! Also please follow me on mastodon, i wanna leave twitter!
